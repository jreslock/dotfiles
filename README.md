## Dotfiles

A set of dotfiles and a script to set them up along with standard tools for my OSX development system.

I mainly use zsh with python and vim so this installs antigen with oh-my-zsh, vim with Vundle and various plugins
as well as installing Homebrew and various system packages required for software build and dev work.
